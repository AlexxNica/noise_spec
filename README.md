Noise
---------
Noise is a framework for crypto protocols based on Diffie-Hellman key agreement.

Specification
---------------

The Noise specification is stored in noise.md as Pandoc Markdown.  The Makefile
processes the source file to produce HTML and PDF.

Only a few Pandoc features are used:

 - Metadata at top of file

 - Zero-numbered lists (WARNING: the Github display of these numbered lists
   shows them starting at 1, instead of 0)
