Noise
---------
Noise is a framework for crypto protocols based on Diffie-Hellman key agreement.

Specification
---------------

The Noise specification is stored in [noise.md](noise.md) as Pandoc Markdown.
The [Makefile](Makefile) processes the source file to produce HTML and PDF.

Only a few Pandoc features are used:

 - Metadata at top of file.

 - Reference links use Pandoc's "implicit_header_references" (clicking on these
   links in the Github display doesn't do anything).

 - Zero-numbered lists (warning: the Github display of these numbered lists
   shows them starting at 1, instead of 0).

 - Table of contents and metadata headers added to output.
